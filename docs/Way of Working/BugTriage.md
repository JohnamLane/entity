# Bug Triage 

## Steps
1. QA, or user identify a bug or dev team member raise a Bug
   - can it be linked to a Story???
1. QA creates issue and label it as "bug"
1. Based on the Sprint Goal and the severity of the bug, the developer decides if this bug should be fixed immediatetly 
   - If yes, inform (in-person or RocketChat) the PO about the amount of effor to fix the bug, and the impact on the committed work
   Decision: High Priority = high severity + high criticality (low, medium or high) User Impact(what impact is), Volume of users, Data impact  Define Priority 1, 2, 3 and meaning 
1. If not for this Sprint, assign to the BA
1. BA analyses the Bug - what impact, risk or dependency etc. 
1. BA discuss with PO about "Priority" 
1. PO make final decision: a) bring into current Sprint or b) put in Backlog 



## Improvements & Ideas
1. Differentiate btw. bugs and defects (in PROD) 
1. Put defects in Sprint Backlog - pull - assign - In Progress - PO ...
1. We need a way to proceed on new high-priority (eg, blocking) bugs when PO is not available
