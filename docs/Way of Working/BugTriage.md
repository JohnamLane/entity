# Bug Triage 

## Steps
1. QA, or user identify a bug or dev team member raise a Bug
   - can it be linked to a Story???
2. QA creates issue and label it as "bug"
3. Based on the Sprint Goal and the severity of the bug, the developer decides if this bug should be fixed immediatetly 
   - If yes, inform (in-person or RocketChat) the PO about the amount of effor to fix the bug, and the impact on the committed work
   * Decision: High Priority = high severity + high criticality (low, medium or high) is based on
   * User Impact (what impact is), Volume of users, Data impact  
   * Define Priority 1, 2, 3 and meaning 
4. If bug is not relevant for this Sprint, assign it to the BA
5. BA analyses the Bug - what impact, risk or dependency, etc. 
6. BA discuss with PO about "Priority" 
   * Decision? 
7. PO make final decision: a) bring into current Sprint or b) put in Backlog 



## Improvements & Ideas
(1). Differentiate btw. bugs and defects (in PROD) 
(2). Put defects in Sprint Backlog - pull - assign - In Progress - PO ...
(3). We need a way to proceed on new high-priority (eg, blocking) bugs when PO is not available
(4). Review no. 3 (decision making)?
