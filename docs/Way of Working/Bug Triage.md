Bug Triage 

**Relationships**

**Steps:**
1. QA, or user identify a bug or dev team member raise a Bug
   - can it be linked to a Story???
2. QA creates issue and label it as "bug"
3. Based on the Sprint Goal and the severity of the bug, the developer decides if this bug should be fixed immediatetly 
   - If yes, inform the PO (in-person or RocketChat) about the amount of effort needed to fix the bug, and the impact on the committed work
   * Decision then is based on:            High Priority = high severity + high criticality (low, medium or high) and 
                                          + User Impact (what impact), Volume of users, Data impact  
             * Define Priority 1, 2, 3 and meaning 
4. If Bug should not be fixed this Sprint, assign to the BA
5. BA analyses the Bug - what impact, risk or dependency etc. 
6. BA discuss with PO about "Priority" 
7. PO make final decision: a) bring into current Sprint or b) put in Backlog 



**Improvements & Ideas**
* (1) Differentiate btw. bugs and defects (in PROD) 
* (2) Put defects in Sprint Backlog - pull - assign - In Progress - PO ...
* (3) We need a way to proceed on new high-priority (eg, blocking) bugs when PO is not available
