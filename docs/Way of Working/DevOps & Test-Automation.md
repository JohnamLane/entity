I. This Epic is an overview to this topic and includes a description and ideas, from the team and documents such as the recommendations from John Lane. 
II. Action items will be defined as stories (issue). 
III. A story will be pulled into a Sprint to work on it, track the progress and see the progress. 

**Problem:**              
Manual testing: Benefits of a DevOps CI/CD process have been missed - slowing down both teams

**What we want:**     
Frequent releases (every Sprint) of quality product, test-automation where possible for faster testing


**_Related and relevant topics:_**
Test Strategy 
Test Process 
Environments 
Monitoring 


**Next Steps & Actions identified:** 
- [ ] Sprint 20: Workshop w. Roland (Thor) - story created:   #2148
- [ ] Sprint 20: SRE DevOps Assessment (Thor) --- Recommendations and tickets to our backlog. 
- [ ] Sprint 21: Update DoD to include functional, integration test (Waldemar) 
- [ ] Sprint 22: Integration testing should be part of a user story/ QA is part of a Scrum Team (Waldemar) 
--- Thor to create user stories and link them to this Epic . 
_----- Thor is working together with Roland Stens and John Lane -----_

_John created a document with current status, ideas and recommendations - see attachment in comment._ 

1)	Product Owners  should lead the teams through DevOps self-assessments  at regular intervals. 
Gaps identified in this review should be discussed and prioritized as part of backlog grooming and sprint planning. 
2)	Each story must include automated unit and integration tests that run in a pipeline prior to being considered complete. 
3)	The team (beginning with the Product Owner and Scrum Master) should begin to track certain key metrics related to system/process health. Here are some good ones to start with:
a.	Application usage and traffic (who is using our app and are they successful?)
b.	# of failed deployments (releases that cause bugs/outages)
c.	Lead time to production (elapsed time from moving to in progress to being in production)
d.	Mean time to recovery (How long a bug lives in production)
