Daily Scrum 

- What I did complete yesterday - to help team meet the Sprint Goal
- What I want to get done today  - to help team meet the Sprint Goal
- Do I see any blocker that might prevent meet the Goal; do I need support/ help
- Can we achieve our Sprint Goal? - Yes or No (why not)

remind Dev team about PRs at Stand-up 

* Show Burndown - discuss the sprint burn down at each stand-up and what remediation action is required 
(Discussing the sprint burn down during the daily stand-up encourages team accountability for the commitment made to the PO during sprint planning)
